This folder contains my LeetCode solutions

Questions marked with a UF (unfinished) after the question id are ones which were accepted but have one of the following  
    - non-optimal solution that should not have been accepted  
        - bad runtime or space management  
    - cheating (violating a restriction or rule stated in the leetcode question)  

Questions marked with an NC (not commented) after the question are ones which were accepted but have the following  
    - no comments or explanation to the code / runtime

I try to only put fully commented code in this folder so it may be a little lacking
I'm also trying to go in order so I don't miss one
