72. Edit Distance (https://leetcode.com/problems/edit-distance/description/)

given string word1 and index i you have the following choices:
    1. insert a character at index i (maybe)
    2. remove the character at index i
    3. replace the character at index i
    4. do nothing and move on to index i+1

dawg this question is way too difficult :(
i'll do this later
